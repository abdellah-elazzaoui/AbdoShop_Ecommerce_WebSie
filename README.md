This Django REST API powers an e-commerce platform that manages products, carts, and payments. It allows users to browse products, add items to carts, register and authenticate, and complete secure transactions via PayPal or Flutterwave. The system also tracks orders, verifies payments, and updates user and cart data automatically.
